Weather radars can detect bird migration, but visualizing these data in an easy to understand manner is challenging. Inspired by [air](http://air.nullschool.net) - an [open source](https://github.com/cambecc/air) flow visualization of wind in Tokyo - we wondered if we could do the same for bird migration data.

So, last week our team created a bird migration flow visualization during a 5 day hackathon, hosted at the [University of Amsterdam](https://ibed.uva.nl/) in collaboration with the [KNMI](http://www.knmi.nl/). It was created for the [European Network for the Radar Surveillance of Animal Movement (ENRAM)](http://enram.eu) and funded by [COST](http://cost.eu/) as a short term scientific mission. The long-term goal of ENRAM is to retrieve this kind of data at a European scale.

We are quite happy with the result and are looking forward to improve upon our proof of concept in the ENRAM data challenge (to be organized late 2014/early 2015).
