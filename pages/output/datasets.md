## GBIF-registered datasets

Most of the data we publish is registered with the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org), an international network and research infrastructure providing open access to biodiversity data.

We help researchers meet the GBIF publication requirements by standardizing their data to the [Darwin Core standard](https://dwc.tdwg.org) and documenting their datasets with metadata. Some of these datasets are further described in peer-reviewed data papers. We have published data for [INBO](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/1cd669d0-80ea-11de-a9d0-f1765f95f18b), [Natuurpunt](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/4d3ceea8-5699-439d-a899-decac9cbbdac), [Flanders Environment Agency (VMM)](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/ec5f9a9c-09b0-4da3-ae8e-22627620fff6) and others. Most of these datasets are published through the [INBO IPT](https://ipt.inbo.be/), an [Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](https://www.gbif.org/en/ipt) we host and maintain.

## Other datasets

In addition to GBIF-registered datasets, we also provide technical support for the publication of datasets that cannot be expressed in the Darwin Core standard. We publish these on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), a general purpose research repository.
